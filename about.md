            <h1>Douglas Higgins, Ph.D.</h1>
            <p>With a deep foundation in microbial biology and years of hands-on experience, I bring both wet lab expertise and computational problem-solving to the table. </p>
            <p>After completing my Ph.D. in Molecular Biology at Princeton University and a postdoc on the Microbial Communities team at the <a href="https://www.jbei.org">Joint BioEnergy Institute</a>, I joined the agricultural biotech <a href="https://www.pivotbio.com">Pivot Bio</a> where I led the Strain Characterization team. At Pivot, I established the companyâ€™s standards for species identification. My work, in collaboration with the regulatory team, outside strain banks, and other product development teams, ensured that all product candidates were accurately classified and met the highest regulatory and scientific standards. I further supported these efforts by developing, maintaining, and running analytical and bioinformatics analyses.</p>
